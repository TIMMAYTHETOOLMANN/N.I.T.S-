# Precision Intelligence Enhancement Patch

## Overview

The **Precision Intelligence Enhancement Patch** upgrades the N.I.T.S. system to provide prosecutorial-grade, statute-backed violation evidence with precise text extraction and logical reasoning.

## What It Does

### 1. Extended Violation Model

The `Violation` interface has been enhanced with the following optional fields:

```typescript
interface Violation {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  /** Exact text span or snippet triggering this violation */
  documentSpan?: { start: number; end: number };
  
  /** Extracted snippet of content (text or table cell) */
  extractedText?: string;
  
  /** The type of evidence: text, table, footnote */
  evidenceType?: 'text' | 'table' | 'footnote';
  
  /** Logical explanation why this match triggers the violation */
  triggerLogic?: string;
  
  /** Estimated penalty or exposure */
  estimatedPenalties?: {
    monetary?: number;
    imprisonment?: number;
    civilFine?: boolean;
  };
}
```

### 2. Actionable Violation Filtering

A new `filterActionableViolations()` method has been added to `TerminatorAnalysisEngine` that:

- Filters violations with **confidence >= 80%**
- Filters violations with **severity >= 60**
- Requires violations to have a **statute** citation
- Requires violations to have **extractedText** (context)

This ensures only high-quality, actionable violations with proper evidence make it into final reports.

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

The system intelligently handles edge cases:
- If actionable violations are found → return only those (high-precision mode)
- If no actionable violations exist → return all violations (maintains sensitivity)

## Installation

### Step 1: Run the Patch Script

```bash
npx tsx deploy/enhancement_precision_patch.ts
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Patch `core/analysis/Violation.ts` with new fields
2. ✅ Patch `core/analysis/TerminatorAnalysisEngine.ts` with filtering logic
3. ℹ️  Confirm compatibility with existing report generators

### Step 2: Verify the Patches

```bash
# Run the complete integration test
npx tsx deploy/complete_integration_patch.ts

# Or run the full deployment
npx tsx deploy/nits_deployment_full.ts
```

### Step 3: Test with Sample Documents

Place test documents in `sample_docs/` and run the analysis:

```bash
npx tsx deploy/complete_integration_patch.ts
```

Check the output in `output/analysis_report.md` and `output/corpus_analysis_report.md`.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Populating New Fields in Custom Detectors

When creating violations, you can now include precise context:

```typescript
violations.push({
  type: 'SECURITIES_FRAUD',
  statute: '15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)',
  description: 'Material misrepresentation detected',
  evidence: ['Found in financial statement'],
  confidence: 95,
  severity: 90,
  penalties: [
    { type: 'MONETARY', amount: 10000000, text: '$10M SEC fine' }
  ],
  recommendation: 'IMMEDIATE_INVESTIGATION',
  
  // New precision fields
  extractedText: 'Revenue increased by 300% due to aggressive accounting practices',
  documentSpan: { start: 1250, end: 1340 },
  evidenceType: 'text',
  triggerLogic: 'Pattern matches known fraudulent language patterns: "aggressive accounting" + percentage claim without supporting evidence',
  estimatedPenalties: {
    monetary: 10000000,
    imprisonment: 20,
    civilFine: true
  }
});
```

### Example 2: Accessing Filtered Violations

The `terminateDocument()` method now automatically filters violations:

```typescript
const violations = await engine.terminateDocument(documentText);
// violations now contains only actionable, high-confidence violations
// (or all violations if no actionable ones exist)
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Prosecutorial-Grade Evidence
- Every violation includes exact text that triggered it
- Logical reasoning explains why it's a violation
- Statute citations are enforced

### ✅ Reduced False Positives
- Only high-confidence violations (≥80%) with proper context are returned
- Low-quality detections are filtered out automatically

### ✅ Better Reporting
- Reports can now show exact excerpts from documents
- Investigators can quickly locate problematic content
- Logical reasoning helps non-technical stakeholders understand violations

### ✅ Financial Impact Clarity
- Estimated penalties provide immediate risk assessment
- Helps prioritize which violations to investigate first

## Compatibility

The patch is **fully backward compatible**:
- All new fields are optional (`?`)
- Existing code continues to work without modification
- Old violations without new fields still function normally
- Report generators automatically use new fields when available

## Idempotency

The patch script can be run multiple times safely:
- Checks if fields already exist before adding them
- Checks if filter method exists before adding it
- Won't duplicate code on repeated runs

## Next Steps

### For Developers

1. **Update Violation Generators**: Modify your custom violation detection code to populate the new fields
2. **Enhance Reports**: Update report templates to display `extractedText`, `triggerLogic`, etc.
3. **Tune Filters**: Adjust confidence/severity thresholds in `filterActionableViolations()` if needed

### For Analysts

1. **Review Reports**: Check that violations now include more context
2. **Verify Accuracy**: Ensure `extractedText` matches actual document content
3. **Use Trigger Logic**: Leverage the explanation field to understand detections

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Violation model file not found"
**Solution**: Ensure you're running the script from the repository root directory.

### Issue: Duplicate filter methods added
**Solution**: The latest version includes idempotency checks. Restore from backup and run the updated script.

### Issue: TypeScript compilation errors
**Solution**: The existing codebase has some TypeScript configuration issues (e.g., missing `@types/node`). These are pre-existing and not related to the patch. Use `npx tsx` to run scripts instead of `tsc`.

## Files Modified
